#Type:     Reflected Cross-Site Scripting
#Affected Versions:  v7.0.1.19219

A reflected cross site scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in the wff_cols_pref.css.aspx endpoint, where user supplied input placed within the URL path filename is returned unsanitized in the application’s HTTP response. An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript by crafting a malicious request to this endpoint. While simple payloads execute as is, certain characters must be encoded to bypass the application’s input validation controls. Successful exploitation allows execution of attacker controlled script in the context of the affected application.
